# Esena
A [ray tracer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics)) written in Scala. 

### Viewing the output
Right now, the program generates a PPM file. You need a software that can 
understand the PPM format, like GIMP, to view the rendered output.  

Here is the current rendered image:

Note: This isn't the final output yet. There is also an on-going [rust version](https://github.com/melvic-ybanez/erena) of this project. The latter is currently being given more attention so this project's development has been indefinitely stopped.

See [The Ray Tracer Challenge](https://pragprog.com/titles/jbtracer/the-ray-tracer-challenge/) for an excellent read on how to implement your own ray tracer. This project uses that book as the primary source of information.
